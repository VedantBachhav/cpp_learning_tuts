/*What is inheritance in cpp.
* The  concept of Reusability in c++ is suppoted using Inheritance.
* We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheritance from it.
* The existing class is called as the BASE CLASS.
* The new class which is inheritance is called as the DERIVED CLASS.
* Reusing classes saves time and money.
* There are different types of inheritance in c++.



Types of inheritance in cpp :

1) Single inheritance : A derived class with only one Base class.

2) Multiple inheritance :  A derived class with more than one Base class.

3) Hierachical inheritance : Several derived classes from a Single Base class.

4) Multilevel inheritance  : Deriving  a class from already derived class.

5) Hybrid inheritance  : Hybrid inheritance is a combination of Multipal INHERITANCE and Multilevel INHERITANCE.
* A class is derived from two classes as in Multipal inheritance.
* However, one of the parent classesin not a base class.
